üö® CRITICAL DISCLAIMER: DO NOT EXECUTE TRADES BASED ON THIS CODE üö®
Project Limitations and Realistic Perspective
üîç What This Project Is
Remember: This is a learning project, not a money-making tool.

A proof of concept demonstrating machine learning and sentiment analysis techniques
An educational exploration of potential trading strategy concepts
NOT a production-ready trading system

‚ùå Why You Should NOT Use This for Actual Trading

Extremely Limited Dataset

Only 30 days of historical data
Statistically insignificant sample size
High risk of overfitting and false positives


Artificial Performance Inflation

Deliberately selected short-term data
Techniques that artificially boost prediction accuracy
No real-world validation


Modeling Decisions Explained
Feature Engineering Choices:

Binary UP/DOWN classification (oversimplified)
Limited technical indicators
No transaction cost considerations

Sentiment Analysis Limitations:

Naive sentiment scoring
Removes critical context from news headlines
Assumes direct correlation between sentiment and stock price


Why the Results Look "Amazing"

Captured a potentially bullish period for NVIDIA
Short-term momentum trading simulation
No long-term predictive power
Survival bias in data selection



üöÄ What a Real Trading Strategy Would Look Like
A professional quantitative trading strategy would:

Use 5-10 years of historical data
Implement robust cross-validation
Account for:

Transaction costs
Market friction
Different market regimes


Use ensemble methods
Continuously re-train and validate models
Have strict risk management protocols

ü§ñ Machine Learning in Trading: Real Perspective

No trader would publish a truly profitable strategy on GitHub
Most successful strategies:

Are proprietary
Require constant refinement
Have marginal predictive power


Typical professional strategies aim for 51-55% accuracy

üõ† Future Improvements

Expand dataset to multiple years
Implement walk-forward validation
Add robust risk management
Incorporate more sophisticated feature engineering
Use more advanced NLP for sentiment analysis

üî¨ Methodology Transparency
Key Modeling Decisions:

Short-term POC focused on learning
Intentionally simplified to illustrate concepts
NOT designed for actual trading

Recommended Next Steps

Learn from the conceptual approach
Do NOT use for real trading
Understand the limitations of predictive modeling
Continue learning and improving
