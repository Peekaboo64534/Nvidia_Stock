# NVIDIA Stock Trading Strategy

**Disclaimer: This is a Learning Project, Not a Money-Making Tool**

## What This Project Is

This is a *proof of concept* exploring machine learning and sentiment analysis in stock trading. It's an **educational experiment**, not a production-ready trading system.

## Why You Shouldn't Use This for Actual Trading

### Data Limitations
- *Extremely small dataset*: Only 30 days of historical data
- **Statistically insignificant** sample size
- High risk of *overfitting and false positives*

### Performance Inflation
- Deliberately selected short-term data
- **Artificial techniques** that boost prediction accuracy
- *No real-world validation*

### Modeling Decisions
- **Oversimplified approach**:
  - Binary UP/DOWN stock movement classification
  - Limited technical indicators
  - *No transaction cost considerations*

### Why Results Look "Amazing"
- Captured a *potentially bullish period* for NVIDIA
- **Short-term momentum trading simulation**
- *No long-term predictive power*

## The Reality of Trading Strategies

**Professional quantitative strategies:**
- Use 5-10 years of historical data
- Implement *robust cross-validation*
- Account for:
  - Transaction costs
  - Market friction
  - Changing market conditions
- **Continuously re-train and validate models**

### Insider Perspective
- *No serious trader would publish a truly profitable strategy on GitHub*
- Most successful strategies:
  - Are **proprietary**
  - Require *constant refinement*
  - Have *marginal* predictive power

## Future Potential Improvements
- Expand dataset to multiple years
- **Implement more sophisticated validation**
- Add robust risk management
- Use advanced natural language processing

## Key Takeaway
**This is a learning project.** Its value lies in understanding the *complexities of predictive modeling*, not in generating actual trading profits.
